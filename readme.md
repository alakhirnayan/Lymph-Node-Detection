# Mediastinal Lymph Node Detection and Segmentation Using Deep Learning

This repository contains code for automatic detection and segmentation of mediastinal lymph nodes from CT images using a modified UNet++ architecture. The method enhances the segmentation accuracy by integrating bilinear interpolation and a total generalized variation (TGV) based upsampling strategy.

The system was trained and tested using CT image data from TCIA, 5-patient dataset, and the ELCAP public dataset. The modified UNet++ achieved superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### 1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

If not already installed, download and install Miniconda for your OS.

### 2. Create and Activate Environment

Open terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:

```bash
conda create -n lymphnode python=3.8 -y
conda activate lymphnode
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install these manually:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tqdm pydicom matplotlib imageio nibabel scikit-image dicom2nifti
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Step 1: Convert DICOM to NIfTI

```bash
python convert.py
```

This will convert DICOM directories to `.nii` files.

### Step 2: Convert `.nii` files and annotations to image-mask pairs

```bash
python process_data.py
```

Make sure the dataset structure is as expected, and that JSON annotation files are correctly paired.

### Step 3: Run Experiments

Open the provided notebooks:

* `P1.ipynb` ‚Äì Preprocessing and setup.
* `P2.ipynb` ‚Äì Model training.
* `P3.ipynb` ‚Äì Evaluation and metrics.

You can run these using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
